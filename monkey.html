                   <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                   <p>The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in Malaysia, Burma, and Thailand.</p>
                   <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of dusky leaf monkeys is their social structure and behavior. They live in cohesive groups led by a dominant male, who protects and guides the troop. Within these social units, intricate relationships are formed through grooming, vocalizations, and body language. Young dusky leaf monkeys, adorned with bright orange fur, add a vibrant contrast to the subdued tones of the adults. As they grow, their coats gradually darken, eventually resembling the mature members of the troop. Despite facing threats from habitat loss and hunting, these fascinating primates continue to thrive in their forest homes, captivating the hearts of those fortunate enough to encounter them in the wild.</p>

                    <u><strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong></u>
                   <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
