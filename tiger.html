                   <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>Tigers, majestic creatures of the wild, are renowned for their striking appearance and powerful presence. With their distinctive orange fur marked by black stripes, they are instantly recognizable and hold a special place in human culture, often symbolizing strength, courage, and ferocity. These magnificent felines are the largest of all cat species, with some individuals weighing over 600 pounds and measuring up to 10 feet in length, including their tail. Their muscular bodies and keen senses make them apex predators in their habitats, capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves with stealth and precision.</p>

                   <p>Tigers are solitary hunters, prowling through dense forests, grasslands, and swamps in search of food. They are primarily nocturnal, using their keen eyesight and acute hearing to stalk prey under the cover of darkness. Despite their solitary nature, tigers have been known to communicate through vocalizations such as roars, growls, and chuffs, particularly during mating season or when defending their territory. However, their populations have been greatly threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, pushing many species to the brink of extinction.</p>

                    <u><strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong></u>
                   <p>You will find the tigers at B12, a few steps ahead of the lions.</p>
